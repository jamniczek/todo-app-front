The frond-end part of junior recruitment task from: https://github.com/qunabu/junior-recruitment-task. 

The app can be seen here: https://jamniczek.github.io/todo-app-front/ Bear in mind that fetching todos may take couple of seconds since the backend if deployed on Heroku and it requires a moment to boot. Other than that feel free to play with it, I'd appreciate if you restrained youself from leaving any offensive ontent there though, since there is no authenticatoin nor login (as mentioned in the task).

The app is built with vanilla JS (accordingly to specification), I also used BEM methodology in terms of scss class naming and general structure. Look of the app is done accordingly to he .psd file provided with the task.

The back-end of the app serves as a controller in MVC pattern and can be seen here with more details: https://github.com/jamniczek/todo-app-backend
